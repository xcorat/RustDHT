# Use Cases: What RustDHT Enables

RustDHT's technical capabilities translate into practical applications that challenge centralized infrastructure and restore user agency over digital tools.

## Offline-Native Productivity Tools

### The Local-First Software Paradigm

Local-first software prioritizes working on local devices, with network connectivity as enhancement rather than requirement.

**Core Principles:**
- Data resides primarily on user's device
- Applications work fully offline
- Network used for sync and collaboration
- No degraded experience without connectivity

### Example: Anytype on IPFS

Anytype demonstrates this approach: "Anytype uses the content addressing on IPFS to empower users to build personal knowledge webs that can be shared with others"[^1].

**Key Features:**
- Personal knowledge management
- Works offline by default
- P2P sync when connected
- User owns all data

### How RustDHT Enables This

**Offline-First Architecture:**
- Local storage (IndexedDB) for all user data
- CRDT-based merging handles offline edits
- GossipSub propagates updates when online
- No server required for basic operation

**Graph Data Model:**
Perfect for knowledge management:
- Notes as nodes with flexible properties
- Connections as links between related concepts
- Tags, categories, backlinks naturally represented
- Schema-less structure adapts to user needs

**Conflict Resolution:**
HAM-inspired CRDT ensures:
- Concurrent edits merge automatically
- No "sync conflicts" to resolve manually
- Predictable outcomes across devices
- Work continues seamlessly offline

### Potential Applications
