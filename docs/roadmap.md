# Development Roadmap

RustDHT follows an iterative development approach, building core functionality incrementally while maintaining a production-ready foundation. This roadmap reflects current priorities and community feedback.

## Current Status (Sprint 2 - Completed)

### âœ… Native P2P Server Operational

**Core Networking:**
- Multi-transport listener supporting TCP and WebRTC
- Combined transport stack using libp2p's or_transport
- Event-driven architecture with Tokio async runtime
- Automatic peer discovery and connection management

**Messaging Protocols:**
- GossipSub implementation for real-time messaging
- Ping protocol for connection health monitoring
- Message authentication via cryptographic signatures
- Topic-based message routing and filtering

**Production Infrastructure:**
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Cross-platform builds (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Health monitoring and diagnostics endpoints

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Sub-second message propagation across mesh network
- Efficient connection multiplexing and resource usage
- Graceful handling of peer connections and disconnections
- Logging and metrics for operational monitoring

## In Progress (Sprint 2.5)

### ðŸ”„ Browser WASM Client

**Current Challenge:**
The browser client is blocked on libp2p dependency compatibility issues. The WebRTC transport (libp2p-webrtc-websys) is lagging behind the main libp2p development, causing version conflicts.

**Resolution Strategy:**

- Incomplete feature set (no DHT storage, limited CRDT support)
- Limited testing and real-world validation
- Browser client compatibility issues
- Performance characteristics not yet optimized

**Infrastructure Dependencies:**
Despite P2P architecture, the system still requires some centralized components:
- Bootstrap nodes for initial network discovery
- STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal in WebRTC
- Signaling servers for WebRTC connection establishment
- DNS infrastructure for human-readable addressing

### Technical Challenges

**Browser Limitations:**
- Cannot reliably listen for incoming connections
- Storage quotas and eviction policies vary by browser
- Limited networking capabilities compared to native applications
- Performance constraints of WebAssembly runtime

**Network Dynamics:**
- Handling network partitions and split-brain scenarios
- Peer discovery in restrictive network environments
- Balancing decentralization with performance requirements
- Economic sustainability without built-in incentive mechanisms

### Realistic Expectations

**Scaling Strategy:**
Rather than claiming to solve all problems immediately, RustDHT follows a pragmatic approach:
- Start with small communities and specific use cases
- Focus on scenarios where P2P provides clear benefits
- Learn from real-world deployment and user feedback
- Gradually expand capabilities based on proven demand

**Ecosystem Collaboration:**
RustDHT is designed to complement, not compete with, existing decentralized systems:
- Integration with IPFS for content storage
- Interoperability with Matrix for communication
- Compatibility with ActivityPub for social applications
- Contribution to broader decentralized web ecosystem
