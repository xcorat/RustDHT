# Use Cases and Applications: What RustDHT Enables

## Overview

This document illustrates the practical and transformative applications of RustDHT by exploring concrete use cases. These examples demonstrate how the technical capabilities described in previous documents translate into real-world applications that challenge centralized infrastructure.

## Offline-Native Productivity Tools

### The Local-First Software Paradigm

Local-first software prioritizes working on local devices, with network connectivity as enhancement rather than requirement.

**Core Principles:**
- Data resides primarily on user's device
- Applications work fully offline
- Network used for sync and collaboration
- No degraded experience without connectivity

### Example: Anytype on IPFS

Anytype demonstrates this approach [https://ipfs.tech/]:
> "Anytype uses the content addressing on IPFS to empower users to build personal knowledge webs that can be shared with others"

**Key Features:**
- Personal knowledge management
- Works offline by default
