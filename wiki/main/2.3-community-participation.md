# Community and Participation

## Overview

This document encourages engagement and contribution to the RustDHT project. As a community-owned collaborative initiative, the project's success depends on diverse participation—from developers and researchers to users and advocates. This is not a corporate product but a commons we build together.

## The "Each Node Strengthens the Network" Ethos

### P2P as Social Model

Peer-to-peer systems embody a fundamental principle: collective strength through individual participation. This is not just technical architecture—it's a social philosophy.

**From IPFS [https://ipfs.tech/]:**
> "Our protocol's success hinges on participation from all of our neighbors: Each new node that joins IPFS makes the network stronger for everyone."

**Why This Matters:**

**In Centralized Systems:**
- More users = heavier server load
- Success requires expensive infrastructure
- Bottlenecks limit growth
- Users are consumers, not contributors

**In Decentralized Systems:**
- More nodes = increased capacity
- Success emerges from participation
- Network grows organically
- Users are active participants
