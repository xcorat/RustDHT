# RustDHT Community Notes: A Whitepaper-Style Documentation

## Overview

This collection of markdown notes serves as source material for creating various types of community engagement content including blog posts, forum discussions, posters, website sections, and educational materials. The documents are written in a whitepaper styleâ€”explanatory rather than promotional, technical yet accessible, and focused on understanding rather than selling.

## Purpose and Approach

These notes represent RustDHT as a **community-owned collaborative project** aimed at building decentralized infrastructure that challenges existing power structures in digital technology. The content:

- **Starts with possibilities** rather than problems
- **Contextualizes** within structural economic issues (capitalism, technofeudalism)
- **Surveys existing solutions** before introducing RustDHT
- **Positions RustDHT** within the broader decentralized ecosystem
- **Maintains technical rigor** while remaining accessible

## Document Structure
