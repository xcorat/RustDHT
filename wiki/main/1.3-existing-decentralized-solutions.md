# Survey of Existing Decentralized Solutions

## Overview

This document establishes the current state of decentralized technology and identifies where different projects fit in the ecosystem. Before introducing RustDHT, it's essential to understand the landscape of existing solutions, their architectural patterns, strengths, and use cases. This survey demonstrates that decentralized systems are not theoreticalâ€”they are production-ready technologies serving real-world applications.

## IPFS: Content-Addressed Distributed Storage

### Core Concept

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer content delivery network built around content addressing: data is stored, retrieved, and located based on the cryptographic hash of its content rather than its location or name [https://ipfs.tech/].

### Key Technical Features

**Content Addressing:**
- Files identified by Content Identifiers (CIDs) derived from cryptographic hashes
- Verifiable data integrity: hash ensures you get exactly what you requested
- Deduplication: identical content has identical CID across the entire network

**Distributed Architecture:**
- No central servers required
- Files stored across multiple nodes
- Peer-to-peer content discovery via DHT
- BitSwap protocol for efficient data exchange

**Network Statistics [https://ipfs.tech/]:**
- 280,000+ unique nodes
- 2,000+ active contributors
- 1 billion+ CIDs published to network

### Real-World Applications

IPFS demonstrates versatility across industries [https://ipfs.tech/]:

**Censorship Resistance:**
- Wikipedia copy posted to IPFS when Turkey blocked access, restoring visibility to millions

**Digital Preservation:**
- Nancy Baker Cahill stores full-resolution art assets: "Resilience is important to me and having the work backed up to Filecoin means they'll be around for a long time"

**Performance Optimization:**
- 3S Studios built IPFS plugin for Unity, reducing game content from 2GB to 40MB

**Productivity Tools:**
- Anytype uses IPFS content addressing to enable "personal knowledge webs that can be shared with others"

**Scientific Collaboration:**
- WeatherXM configured thousands of smart weather stations with IPFS to collaboratively share weather patterns globally

**Web3 Transparency:**
- Snapshot uses IPFS to publicly record proposals, votes, and data for 9,000+ web3 projects and DAOs

### Architectural Strengths

**Open and Distributed:**
- "The IPFS network is distributed and participatory, which reduces the problem of data silos" [https://ipfs.tech/]

**Verifiable:**
- "The integrity of all data is verified using hash functions, so you can trust that you always get the data you're looking for" [https://ipfs.tech/]

**Resilient:**
- "Files and data can be stored across multiple nodes, which keeps content at the ready even during critical outages" [https://ipfs.tech/]

### Use Cases Best Suited For

- Static content distribution
- Permanent data archiving
- Verifiable data integrity
- CDN alternative without centralized control
- NFT storage and retrieval

## Filecoin: Incentivized Storage Layer

### Relationship to IPFS

Filecoin operates as an incentivized storage layer on top of IPFS, addressing a critical challenge: while IPFS enables distributed storage, it doesn't inherently incentivize nodes to store data long-term [https://filecoin.io/].

### Key Technical Features

**Blockchain-Based Incentives:**
- Proof-of-Replication: Cryptographic proof that data is stored
- Proof-of-Spacetime: Proof that data remains stored over time
- Storage marketplace: Users pay for storage, miners earn rewards

**Integration with IPFS:**
- Uses IPFS CIDs for content addressing
- Adds economic layer to ensure persistence
- Miners compete to offer storage at competitive prices

### Architectural Pattern

Filecoin demonstrates the **"layered protocols"** approach:
- IPFS provides technical substrate (content addressing, distribution)
- Filecoin adds economic layer (incentives, payments, verification)

### Use Cases Best Suited For

- Long-term data archiving with economic guarantees
- Critical data requiring provable storage
- Large-scale data storage with verifiable redundancy
- Applications needing both distribution (IPFS) and persistence (Filecoin)

## Holochain: Agent-Centric Distributed Applications

### Core Philosophy

Holochain represents a fundamentally different approach: "agent-centric" rather than "data-centric" architecture. Each user maintains their own source chain of data, with distributed hash table (DHT) for shared state [https://www.holochain.org/].

### Key Technical Features

**Source Chains:**
- Each agent has a personal, append-only chain of cryptographically signed data
- Comparable to a personal blockchain
- Full control over own data

**Distributed Validation:**
- Applications (called "DNAs") embed validation rules
- Randomly selected peers validate data against these rules
- Invalid data triggers network-wide security response
- "Warrants" issued against corrupt peers, leading to exclusion

**No Global Consensus:**
- Avoids blockchain's consensus overhead
- Uses "scaled consent" and distributed validation
- Dramatically improves scalability

### Architectural Strengths

**Community as Infrastructure:**
- "The community itself functions as the infrastructure"
- Network capacity scales with popularity
- Compute and data reside at network edges
- No centralized servers to maintain

**Sharded DHT:**
- Each peer maintains small, random portion of all public data
- Distributes storage and validation workload
- Enables scaling to large networks

**Security Model:**
- Cryptographic audit trails
- Peer validation provides "many eyes" principle
- Immune to traditional blockchain attacks (51% attacks impossible)

### Real-World Performance

Research indicates [from RustDHT's PRD references]:
- ~50ms latency for data publishing on single node
- ~30ms latency for data retrieval
- Scales horizontally with network size

### Use Cases Best Suited For

- Applications requiring agent-centric data models
- Social networks with user-owned data
- Supply chain tracking with distributed validation
- Any application benefiting from "personal data sovereignty"
- Systems needing scalability without global consensus

- **libp2p**: Shared networking infrastructure
- **Standard CRDTs**: Interoperable conflict resolution

**Protocol Composability:**
As noted by Wes Floyd from Bacalhau [https://ipfs.tech/]:
> "As people learn about IPFS, they also get a view of IPFS as a component in a broader ecosystem. It's not an island. It's not a technology that lives entirely on its own, it's a piece of a broader stack of something. We see it as an onramp to broader decentralization."

RustDHT embodies this principle: one component in a larger decentralized infrastructure.
